    The State Archives of Belgium (SAB) is a federal scientific institution that is part of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO). The State Archivesâ€™ role is to ensure the proper preservation of archival documents produced and managed by the state authorities and it has 20 repositories spread throughout the country, including the Study and Documentation Centre for War and Contemporary Society (CEGESOMA). Located in Brussels, this centre examines the wars and conflicts of the 20th century and their impact on Belgium. CEGESOMA collects archives and documentation, conducts research and organises academic and public events. Along with the other repositories that make up the State Archives, it holds key archival collections for the study of the Holocaust and it has been involved in developing (digital) finding aids, inventories and other tools to ensure that these collections are accessible.

    SAB-CEGESOMA has been a partner institution of EHRI since its very first project in 2010 and it has played an integral role in the development of this international research infrastructure, making significant contributions to EHRI's project-based activities and its establishment as a permanent European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). Together with Kazerne Dossin, SAB-CEGESOMA coordinates the activities of EHRI-BE.
