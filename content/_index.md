The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) is a European research infrastructure that supports and promotes Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a transnational level.

EHRI-BE is the national node representing Belgium within this distributed research infrastructure. EHRI-BE is composed of different institutions located in Belgium with expertise in Holocaust documentation, research, commemoration and education at the different levels of the Belgian federal state. 

Modern, democratic Europe developed out of the ashes of Auschwitz, making the Holocaust a defining legacy of European history. To fully grasp the depths of Europeâ€™s darkest period, it is crucial that we continue to learn about, commemorate and research the Holocaust.
