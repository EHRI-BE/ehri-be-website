It is our great pleasure to invite you to a follow-up workshop on Tuesday 15 October 2024 to discuss
the creation of the Belgian node in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure: EHRI-BE. The
workshop will be divided into two parts. Before noon, we will provide you with an update on a number
of significant developments since we last met at Kazerne Dossin in June 2022, including the status of
the EHRI Project and the launch of EHRI-BEâ€™s website. More importantly, it will be an occasion to learn
and discuss activities and opportunities in launching the Belgian node of EHRI. In the afternoon, we
will focus on how EHRI can help smaller institutions and private organisations (micro-archives) in their
daily activities. After presenting the archival tools developed and freely available via EHRI, we will use
examples from daily practice to demonstrate the benefits of, for example, using the EHRI Portal to
present your collections.

This day is open to all interested institutions in Belgium. A more detailed programme will be circulated
closer to the date of the workshop, but the key details are as follows:
* The workshop will take place at [Kazerne Dossin, Goswin de Stassartstraat 153, 2800
Mechelen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KwrYEcdVmRoVzK437), on Tuesday 15 October 2024 from 9:30am to 4pm.
* The morning session will take place from 9:30am to 12:30pm and the afternoon session from
2pm to 4pm. You can register for one or both sessions via the link below.
* The workshop will be in English, but we will be on hand should translation be required.

In order to be able to prepare everything as smoothly as possible, please let us know whether you will
be able to attend both or one of the sessions as soon as possible, and by 25 June 2024 at the latest.
