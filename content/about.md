The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu), which was launched in 2010 and has evolved over the course of several EU-funded projects, is working towards establishing itself as a permanent distributed research infrastructure. Leading Holocaust research, education, and commemorative institutions from more than 20 countries, spread across three continents, will come together under one legal entity to continue their mission of bringing together widely dispersed sources by connecting information, institutions and people.

The EHRI Belgium National Node (EHRI-BE) supports EHRI’s overarching aims by carrying out research, remembrance and educational activities that are relevant to Belgium while also taking into account regional particularities and promoting transnational research. 

EHRI-BE aims to facilitate advancements in fields such as access to archives, archival sciences, scientific research, networking, education, commemoration and remembrance, digital humanities and AI.

EHRI-BE contributes to the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within Belgium and beyond by

* representing Belgian institutions active in the field of documentation, commemoration and research on the Holocaust; 
* establishing and developing a strong and varied research consortium;
* exchanging and sharing expertise on digital developments and connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;
* disseminating, implementing and developing innovative digital research tools;
* offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists and heritage professionals.

EHRI’s impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also pursues a broader social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely academic concern but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across Europe and the world.
